<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->


Provides a different user interface for both the user and the admin
<br><br>
 
 <strong>Brief Description about the project
 <br>
This project provides a different user interface for both client and admin users. The sidebar contains links that can be clicked to change the required fields on the page, while keeping the other components of the page intact.

This makes the project easy to use and navigate for both types of users. The client user can quickly access the information they need, while the admin user can easily manage the content of the page.

The project is built using Angular, which is a popular framework for developing web applications. It is also responsive, so it can be used on a variety of devices, including smartphones and tablets.
